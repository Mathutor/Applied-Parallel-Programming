Simple Matrix Multiplication

1.  How many times is each element of the input matrices loaded during the execution of the kernel?
    Each elements from each input matricies is loaded MATRIX_SIZE times. 


2.  What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each thread?  
    Consider a multiply and addition as separate operations, and ignore the storing 
    of the result.  Only global memory loads should be counted towards 
    your off-chip bandwidth
    There are 32^3 global memory loads and 2* 32^3 FLOPS, which means there are 2 FLOPS / 1 MEM access.
